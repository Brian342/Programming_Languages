# Description: Write a program that randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.
# The user has to guess the number, and the program will give feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
# Use the random module to generate a random number.
# Give the user multiple attempts to guess the number.
# Provide appropriate feedback (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low").
# Exit the game if the user guesses correctly or after a maximum number of attempts.
