# Task 1: To-Do List Application
# Description: Build a simple command-line to-do list application.
# Users should be able to add, delete, mark as done, and list tasks.

# Objectives:
# Implement the ability to add, view, and delete tasks.
# Store the tasks in a file (either CSV or JSON format). Mark tasks as completed.
# Implement basic error handling (e.g., trying to delete a task that doesn’t exist).
